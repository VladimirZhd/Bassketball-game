# Overview

Unity 2d platformer. It is a basketball shooting game on early stage of the development. As of right now you can move the character using keyboard left arrow key and right arrow key. Also, you can jump. The ball is picked up when you step on it, and you can jump-shoot pressing space, but you need to do it in the same frame.

I wrote this game o learn more about unity and game developing with unity engine. While making the game I learned a lot about sprite rendering, animation, and box collision.

# Development Environment

I used Photoshop to draw the character sprite, Unity IDE and Visual Studio for the development.
All of my scripts are in C# using UnityEngine library.
